### Models ###

```
The above model was implemented at the start of the project to help decide workflow.
```

```
The above model was created to enhance on the previous model to give us a clearer picture of how we predicted the final product to work.
```
### Approach ###

Our approach to this project was to focus on the learning objective of the project and really work on and take note of how we worked as a team. We implemented a Trello board to organise and manage our work and used its features to assign tasks and direct workflow.

We also implemented two models (see above) at the start of the process to guide our development. Initially planning on using three classes as we modelled the programs interactions we found the need for a fourth class, the calendar class.

Further as a group we decided to focus on the learnings of collaborative growth, methodical approach and the ability to TDD anything. By focusing on these goals we aimed to enhance our learning experience. The testing approach has gone well with our first feature tests passed and refactored by the morning of Day 2.

After the day 2 retro our focus was on implementing functionality and a minimum viable product to demo at the end of the day. This means that our app lacks any form of design or style, but we are happy that the app functions as it should currently and we can demo future features as part of our MVP.

By Day 3, we had run into numerous problems due to our decision to use ActiveRecord over Datamapper, the debugging necessary to make ActiveRecord work was a long process and ate into much of our time. Sadly this focus on simply getting the program to function led to a negligence of the tests and keeping them working, as such the tests currently do not pass, due to the lack of a fully functioning test database for the most part as well as smaller changes like button or link names. 



### User Journey ###
```
Here the user logs in clicking log in
```

```
Here the user inputs their details and they can login if they have signed up.
```

```
Here the user sees their basic profile and options. Giving them the options to list a space, log out or Browse available properties.
```

```
Here the user has chosen to browse the available properties.
```

```
Clicking on more information, currently displays the same short description. Future work would enable a short description on browse page leading to longer information on dedicated property page.
```

```
Here we have two options, we can return to the property list, or we can request to book the property, the user has selected to book the property.
```

```
And is returned a message to confirming the request has been sent to the owner. With the option to go to the homepage.
```
### User Experience ###
```
Not very good
```
### How we would move forward ###

If we had more time there are several functionalities we would fully implement to create an app that fulfils the basic specifications.

- We would implement a booking confirm method that is available to the booker so bookings can be confirmed to the owner.

- We would implement a calendar class as shown in the class model to fulfil the need for date blocking and avoid properties becoming double booked.

- We would implement an associations system for our spaces so that each property is assigned to the correct user within the database, as currently a user can list multiple spaces but they are not registered to the user.

- We would create either a new class or a child class of user which contains all the necessary methods for listing and  associating properties, as well as being able to confirm bookings.

- We would re-write the Domain model to be more reflective of the finished product.

- We would update the Class model to be more reflective of the program.

- We would update our tests to work, lint our project and complete final refactoring.

### Reflections ###

- Please see folder called RETROS for team reflections at the end of each day.
